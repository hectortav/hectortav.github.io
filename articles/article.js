Everything around me seems to be breaking down, the internet connection takes me back to the 90s and my monitor turns black for no reason. 
Did I finally reach burnout, the inevitable phase every developer has to face at some point? 
It kinda feels like it. I don't have the same energy for my side projects and I postpone my responsibilities.
So what is the source of the problem?
Probably lack of motivation is my main problem, whether that's a reason or an effect of burnout.
I constantly have to work overtime and my effort is underappreciated since I work with non-developers. The API I am working on is really badly documented and stops working for non-apparent reasons. And of course as a younger developer I am significantly underpaid.
Regarding university, I am stack with stupid math and physics problems that don't stimulate me anymore. Math is great, I hate it!
Lastly, I  have to face my side projects, and especially needit.  I work as a solo developer and the humongous amount of work has overtaken me. Don't take me wrong, I like working on it and learning so much new stuff, but the work is simply too much for one person.`,
