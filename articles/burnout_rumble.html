                        <h4>ยง The past week I really feel burned out.</h4>
                        <div>&emsp;Working overtime, keeping up with university, working on side projects and of course lockdown suddenly feel way too much.
                            Everything around me seems to be breaking down, the internet connection takes me back to the 90s and my monitor turns black for no reason. 
                            Did I finally reach burnout, the inevitable phase every developer has to face at some point? 
                            It kinda feels like it. I don't have the same energy for my side projects and I postpone my responsibilities.
                            So what is the source of the problem?
                            Probably lack of motivation is my main problem, whether that's a reason or an effect of burnout.
                            I constantly have to work overtime and my effort is underappreciated since I work with non-developers. The API I am working on is really badly documented and stops working for non-apparent reasons. And of course as a younger developer I am significantly underpaid.
                            Regarding university, I am stack with stupid math and physics problems that don't stimulate me anymore. Math is great, I hate it!
                            Lastly, I  have to face my side projects, and especially needit.  I work as a solo developer and the humongous amount of work has overtaken me. Don't take me wrong, I like working on it and learning so much new stuff, but the work is simply too much for one person.

                        <div>&emsp;Work will get on track, my assignments will be finished in a week and my enthusiasm will kick back in a few days. Hopefully :P</div>
