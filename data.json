		"body": "The following study was executed as part of the course on software development for information systems in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. The aim of this study was to create a subset of a database that manages data entirely in the main memory. The whole task was split in three parts. In the first part we implemented a Sort Merge Join Algorithm, in the second one we performed a query analysis, similar to the one used in the SIGMOD 2018 competition, while in the last part we implemented CPU parallelization and a query optimizer. The project is hosted in GitHub and contains a Makefile for compilation.",
