The aim of this study was to create a subset of a database that manages data entirely in the main memory. The whole task was split in three parts. In the first part we implemented a Sort Merge Join Algorithm, in the second one we performed a query analysis, similar to the one used in the SIGMOD 2018 competition, while in the last part we implemented CPU parallelization and a query optimizer. The project is hosted in GitHub and contains a Makefile for compilation.",
